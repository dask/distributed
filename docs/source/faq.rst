==========================

More questions can be found on StackOverflow at http://stackoverflow.com/search?tab=votes&q=dask%20distributed

How do I use external modules?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use ``client.upload_file``. For more detail, see the `API docs`_ and a 
StackOverflow question
`"Can I use functions imported from .py files in Dask/Distributed?"`__
This function supports both standalone file and setuptools's ``.egg`` files
for larger modules.

Can I launch a tasks from a task?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This could be while averaging inside another function submitted with
dask.distributed. For more detail and explanation, see
http://distributed.readthedocs.io/en/latest/task-launch.html#submit-tasks-from-worker



Too many open file descriptors?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your operating system imposes a limit to how many open files or open network
connections any user can have at once.  Depending on the scale of your
cluster the ``dask-scheduler`` may run into this limit.

By default most Linux distributions set this limit at 1024 open
files/connections and OS-X at 128 or 256.  Each worker adds a few open
connections to a running scheduler (somewhere between one and ten, depending on
how contentious things get.)

If you are on a managed cluster you can usually ask whoever manages your
cluster to increase this limit.  If you have root access and know what you are
doing you can change the limits on Linux by editing
``/etc/security/limits.conf``.  Instructions are here under the heading "User
Level FD Limits":

Error when running dask-worker about ``OMP_NUM_THREADS``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
