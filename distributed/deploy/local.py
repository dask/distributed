class LocalCluster(SpecCluster):
    """ Create local Scheduler and Workers

    This creates a "cluster" of a scheduler and workers running on the local
    machine.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_workers: int
        Number of workers to start
    processes: bool
        Whether to use processes (True) or threads (False).  Defaults to True
    threads_per_worker: int
        Number of threads per each worker
    scheduler_port: int
        Port of the scheduler.  8786 by default, use 0 to choose a random port
    silence_logs: logging level
        Level of logs to print out to stdout.  ``logging.WARN`` by default.
        Use a falsey value like False or None for no change.
    host: string
        Host address on which the scheduler will listen, defaults to only localhost
    ip: string
        Deprecated.  See ``host`` above.
    dashboard_address: str
        Address on which to listen for the Bokeh diagnostics server like
        'localhost:8787' or '0.0.0.0:8787'.  Defaults to ':8787'.
        Set to ``None`` to disable the dashboard.
        Use ':0' for a random port.
    diagnostics_port: int
        Deprecated.  See dashboard_address.
    asynchronous: bool (False by default)
        Set to True if using this cluster within async/await functions or within
        Tornado gen.coroutines.  This should remain False for normal use.
    blocked_handlers: List[str]
        A list of strings specifying a blacklist of handlers to disallow on the Scheduler,
        like ``['feed', 'run_function']``
    service_kwargs: Dict[str, Dict]
        Extra keywords to hand to the running services
    security : Security or bool, optional
        Configures communication security in this cluster. Can be a security
        object, or True. If True, temporary self-signed credentials will
        be created automatically.
    protocol: str (optional)
        Protocol to use like ``tcp://``, ``tls://``, ``inproc://``
        This defaults to sensible choice given other keyword arguments like
        ``processes`` and ``security``
    interface: str (optional)
        Network interface to use.  Defaults to lo/localhost
    worker_class: Worker
        Worker class used to instantiate workers from.
    **worker_kwargs:
        Extra worker arguments. Any additional keyword arguments will be passed
        to the ``Worker`` class constructor.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> cluster = LocalCluster()  # Create a local cluster with as many workers as cores  # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> cluster  # doctest: +SKIP
    LocalCluster("127.0.0.1:8786", workers=8, threads=8)

    >>> c = Client(cluster)  # connect to local cluster  # doctest: +SKIP

    Scale the cluster to three workers

    >>> cluster.scale(3)  # doctest: +SKIP

    Pass extra keyword arguments to Bokeh

    >>> LocalCluster(service_kwargs={'dashboard': {'prefix': '/foo'}})  # doctest: +SKIP
