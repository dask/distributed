    This takes in lots of small objects, writes them to a local directory, and
    then reads them back when all writes are complete.  It buffers these
    objects in memory so that it can optimize disk access for larger writes.

    **State**

    -   shards: dict[str, list[bytes]]

        This is our in-memory buffer of data waiting to be written to files.

    -   sizes: dict[str, int]

        The size of each list of shards.  We find the largest and write data from that buffer

    Parameters
    ----------
    directory : str or pathlib.Path
        Where to write and read data.  Ideally points to fast disk.
    memory_limiter : ResourceLimiter
        Limiter for in-memory buffering (at most this much data)
        before writes to disk occur. If the incoming data that has yet
        to be processed exceeds this limit, then the buffer will block
        until below the threshold. See :meth:`.write` for the
        implementation of this scheme.
