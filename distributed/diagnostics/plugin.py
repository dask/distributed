class SchedulerPlugin:
    """Interface to extend the Scheduler

    The scheduler operates by triggering and responding to events like
    ``task_finished``, ``update_graph``, ``task_erred``, etc..

    A plugin enables custom code to run at each of those same events.  The
    scheduler will run the analogous methods on this class when each event is
    triggered.  This runs user code within the scheduler thread that can
    perform arbitrary operations in synchrony with the scheduler itself.

    Plugins are often used for diagnostics and measurement, but have full
    access to the scheduler and could in principle affect core scheduling.

    To implement a plugin implement some of the methods of this class and add
    the plugin to the scheduler with ``Scheduler.add_plugin(myplugin)``.

    """Interface to extend the Worker

    A worker plugin enables custom code to run at different stages of the Workers'
    lifecycle: at setup, during task state transitions, when a task or dependency
    is released, and at teardown.

    A plugin enables custom code to run at each of step of a Workers's life. Whenever such
    an event happens, the corresponding method on this class will be called. Note that the
    user code always runs within the Worker's main thread.

    To implement a plugin implement some of the methods of this class and register
    the plugin to your client in order to have it attached to every existing and
    future workers with ``Client.register_worker_plugin``.

    This accepts a set of packages to install on all workers.

       This will increase the time it takes to start up
       each worker. If possible, we recommend including the
       libraries in the worker environment or image. This is
       primarily intended for experimentation and debugging.

       Additional issues may arise if multiple workers share the same
       file system. Each worker might try to install the packages
       simultaneously.
