class SchedulerPlugin:
    """ Interface to extend the Scheduler

    The scheduler operates by triggering and responding to events like
    ``task_finished``, ``update_graph``, ``task_erred``, etc..

    A plugin enables custom code to run at each of those same events.  The
    scheduler will run the analogous methods on this class when each event is
    triggered.  This runs user code within the scheduler thread that can
    perform arbitrary operations in synchrony with the scheduler itself.

    Plugins are often used for diagnostics and measurement, but have full
    access to the scheduler and could in principle affect core scheduling.

    To implement a plugin implement some of the methods of this class and add
    the plugin to the scheduler with ``Scheduler.add_plugin(myplugin)``.

class WorkerPlugin:
    """ Interface to extend the Worker

    A worker plugin enables custom code to run at different stages of the Workers'
    lifecycle: at setup, during task state transitions, when a task or dependency
    is released, and at teardown.

    A plugin enables custom code to run at each of step of a Workers's life. Whenever such
    an event happens, the corresponding method on this class will be called. Note that the
    user code always runs within the Worker's main thread.

    To implement a plugin implement some of the methods of this class and register
    the plugin to your client in order to have it attached to every existing and
    future workers with ``Client.register_worker_plugin``.

    --------
    >>> class ErrorLogger(WorkerPlugin):
    ...     def __init__(self, logger):
    ...         self.logger = logger
    ...
    ...     def setup(self, worker):
    ...         self.worker = worker
    ...
    ...     def transition(self, key, start, finish, *args, **kwargs):
    ...         if finish == 'error':

    def setup(self, worker):
        """
        Run when the plugin is attached to a worker. This happens when the plugin is registered
        and attached to existing workers, or when a worker is created after the plugin has been
        registered.

        Throughout the lifecycle of a task (see :doc:`Worker <worker>`), Workers are
        instructed by the scheduler to compute certain tasks, resulting in transitions

        state transition.
