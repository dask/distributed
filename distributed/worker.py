    """Worker node in a Dask distributed cluster

    Workers perform two functions:

    1.  **Serve data** from a local dictionary
    2.  **Perform computation** on that data and on data from peers

    Workers keep the scheduler informed of their data and use that scheduler to
    gather data from other workers when necessary to perform a computation.

    You can start a worker with the ``dask-worker`` command line application::

        $ dask-worker scheduler-ip:port

    Use the ``--help`` flag to see more options::

        $ dask-worker --help

    The rest of this docstring is about the internal state the the worker uses
    to manage and track internal computations.

    **State**

    **Informational State**

    These attributes don't change significantly during execution.

    * **nthreads:** ``int``:
        Number of nthreads used by this worker process
    * **executor:** ``concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor``:
        Executor used to perform computation
        This can also be the string "offload" in which case this uses the same
        thread pool used for offloading communications.  This results in the
        same thread being used for deserialization and computation.
    * **local_directory:** ``path``:
        Path on local machine to store temporary files
    * **scheduler:** ``rpc``:
        Location of scheduler.  See ``.ip/.port`` attributes.
    * **name:** ``string``:
        Alias
    * **services:** ``{str: Server}``:
        Auxiliary web servers running on this worker
    * **service_ports:** ``{str: port}``:
    * **total_out_connections**: ``int``
        The maximum number of concurrent outgoing requests for data
    * **total_in_connections**: ``int``
        The maximum number of concurrent incoming requests for data
    * **total_comm_nbytes**: ``int``
    * **batched_stream**: ``BatchedSend``
        A batched stream along which we communicate to the scheduler
    * **log**: ``[(message)]``
        A structured and queryable log.  See ``Worker.story``

    **Volatile State**

    These attributes track the progress of tasks that this worker is trying to
    complete.  In the descriptions below a ``key`` is the name of a task that
    we want to compute and ``dep`` is the name of a piece of dependent data
    that we want to collect from others.

    * **tasks**: ``{key: TaskState}``
        The tasks currently executing on this worker (and any dependencies of those tasks)
    * **data:** ``{key: object}``:
        Prefer using the **host** attribute instead of this, unless
        memory_limit and at least one of memory_target_fraction or
        memory_spill_fraction values are defined, in that case, this attribute
        is a zict.Buffer, from which information on LRU cache can be queried.
    * **data.memory:** ``{key: object}``:
        Dictionary mapping keys to actual values stored in memory. Only
        available if condition for **data** being a zict.Buffer is met.
    * **data.disk:** ``{key: object}``:
        Dictionary mapping keys to actual values stored on disk. Only
        available if condition for **data** being a zict.Buffer is met.
    * **data_needed**: deque(keys)
        The keys which still require data in order to execute, arranged in a deque
    * **ready**: [keys]
        Keys that are ready to run.  Stored in a LIFO stack
    * **constrained**: [keys]
        Keys for which we have the data to run, but are waiting on abstract
        resources like GPUs.  Stored in a FIFO deque
    * **executing_count**: ``int``
        A count of tasks currently executing on this worker
    * **executed_count**: int
        A number of tasks that this worker has run in its lifetime
    * **long_running**: {keys}
        A set of keys of tasks that are running and have started their own
        long-running clients.
    * **has_what**: ``{worker: {deps}}``
        The data that we care about that we think a worker has
    * **pending_data_per_worker**: ``{worker: [dep]}``
        The data on each worker that we still want, prioritized as a deque
    * **in_flight_tasks**: ``int``
        A count of the number of tasks that are coming to us in current
        peer-to-peer connections
    * **in_flight_workers**: ``{worker: {task}}``
        The workers from which we are currently gathering data and the
        dependencies we expect from those connections
    * **comm_bytes**: ``int``
        The total number of bytes in flight
    * **threads**: ``{key: int}``
        The ID of the thread on which the task ran
    * **active_threads**: ``{int: key}``
        The keys currently running on active threads
    * **waiting_for_data_count**: ``int``
        A count of how many tasks are currently waiting for data


    Parameters
    ----------
    scheduler_ip: str
    scheduler_port: int
    ip: str, optional
    data: MutableMapping, type, None
        The object to use for storage, builds a disk-backed LRU dict by default
    nthreads: int, optional
    loop: tornado.ioloop.IOLoop
    local_directory: str, optional
        Directory where we place local resources
    name: str, optional
    memory_limit: int, float, string
        Number of bytes of memory that this worker should use.
        Set to zero for no limit.  Set to 'auto' to calculate
        as system.MEMORY_LIMIT * min(1, nthreads / total_cores)
        Use strings or numbers like 5GB or 5e9
    memory_target_fraction: float
        Fraction of memory to try to stay beneath
    memory_spill_fraction: float
        Fraction of memory at which we start spilling to disk
    memory_pause_fraction: float
        Fraction of memory at which we stop running new tasks
    executor: concurrent.futures.Executor
    resources: dict
        Resources that this worker has like ``{'GPU': 2}``
    nanny: str
        Address on which to contact nanny, if it exists
    lifetime: str
        Amount of time like "1 hour" after which we gracefully shut down the worker.
        This defaults to None, meaning no explicit shutdown time.
    lifetime_stagger: str
        Amount of time like "5 minutes" to stagger the lifetime value
        The actual lifetime will be selected uniformly at random between
        lifetime +/- lifetime_stagger
    lifetime_restart: bool
        Whether or not to restart a worker after it has reached its lifetime
        Default False

    Examples
    --------

    Use the command line to start a worker::

        $ dask-scheduler
        Start scheduler at 127.0.0.1:8786

        $ dask-worker 127.0.0.1:8786
        Start worker at:               127.0.0.1:1234
        Registered with scheduler at:  127.0.0.1:8786
