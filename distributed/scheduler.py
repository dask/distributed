        **Design note on managed memory**

        There are two measures available for managed memory:

        - ``self.nbytes``
        - ``self.metrics["managed_bytes"]``

        At rest, the two numbers must be identical. However, ``self.nbytes`` is
        immediately updated through the batched comms as soon as each task lands in
        memory on the worker; ``self.metrics["managed_bytes"]`` instead is updated by
        the heartbeat, which can lag several seconds behind.

        Below we are mixing likely newer managed memory info from ``self.nbytes`` with
        process and spilled memory from the heartbeat. This is deliberate, so that
        managed memory total is updated more frequently.

        Managed memory directly and immediately contributes to optimistic memory, which
        is in turn used in Active Memory Manager heuristics (at the moment of writing;
        more uses will likely be added in the future). So it's important to have it
        up to date; much more than it is for process memory.

        Having up-to-date managed memory info as soon as the scheduler learns about
        task completion also substantially simplifies unit tests.

        The flip side of this design is that it may cause some noise in the
        unmanaged_recent measure. e.g.:

        1. Delete 100MB of managed data
        2. The updated managed memory reaches the scheduler faster than the
           updated process memory
        3. There's a blip where the scheduler thinks that there's a sudden 100MB
           increase in unmanaged_recent, since process memory hasn't changed but managed
           memory has decreased by 100MB
        4. When the heartbeat arrives, process memory goes down and so does the
           unmanaged_recent.

        This is OK - one of the main reasons for the unmanaged_recent / unmanaged_old
        split is exactly to concentrate all the noise in unmanaged_recent and exclude it
        from optimistic memory, which is used for heuristics.

        Something that is less OK, but also less frequent, is that the sudden deletion
        of spilled keys will cause a negative blip in managed memory:

        1. Delete 100MB of spilled data
        2. The updated managed memory *total* reaches the scheduler faster than the
           updated spilled portion
        3. This causes the managed memory to temporarily plummet and be replaced by
           unmanaged_recent, while spilled memory remains unaltered
        4. When the heartbeat arrives, managed goes back up, unmanaged_recent
           goes back down, and spilled goes down by 100MB as it should have to
           begin with.

        :issue:`6002` will let us solve this.

class Scheduler(SchedulerState, ServerNode):
    """Dynamic distributed task scheduler

    The scheduler tracks the current state of workers, data, and computations.
    The scheduler listens for events and responds by controlling workers
    appropriately.  It continuously tries to use the workers to execute an ever
    growing dask graph.

    All events are handled quickly, in linear time with respect to their input
    (which is often of constant size) and generally within a millisecond.  To
    accomplish this the scheduler tracks a lot of state.  Every operation
    maintains the consistency of this state.

    The scheduler communicates with the outside world through Comm objects.
    It maintains a consistent and valid view of the world even when listening
    to several clients at once.

    A Scheduler is typically started either with the ``dask scheduler``
    executable::

         $ dask scheduler
         Scheduler started at 127.0.0.1:8786

    Or within a LocalCluster a Client starts up without connection
    information::

        >>> c = Client()  # doctest: +SKIP
        >>> c.cluster.scheduler  # doctest: +SKIP
        Scheduler(...)

    Users typically do not interact with the scheduler directly but rather with
    the client object ``Client``.

    The ``contact_address`` parameter allows to advertise a specific address to
    the workers for communication with the scheduler, which is different than
    the address the scheduler binds to. This is useful when the scheduler
    listens on a private address, which therefore cannot be used by the workers
    to contact it.

    **State**

    The scheduler contains the following state variables.  Each variable is
    listed along with what it stores and a brief description.

    * **tasks:** ``{task key: TaskState}``
        Tasks currently known to the scheduler
    * **unrunnable:** ``{TaskState}``
        Tasks in the "no-worker" state

    * **workers:** ``{worker key: WorkerState}``
        Workers currently connected to the scheduler
    * **idle:** ``{WorkerState}``:
        Set of workers that are not fully utilized
    * **saturated:** ``{WorkerState}``:
        Set of workers that are not over-utilized

    * **host_info:** ``{hostname: dict}``:
        Information about each worker host

    * **clients:** ``{client key: ClientState}``
        Clients currently connected to the scheduler

    * **services:** ``{str: port}``:
        Other services running on this scheduler, like Bokeh
    * **loop:** ``IOLoop``:
        The running Tornado IOLoop
    * **client_comms:** ``{client key: Comm}``
        For each client, a Comm object used to receive task requests and
        report task status updates.
    * **stream_comms:** ``{worker key: Comm}``
        For each worker, a Comm object from which we both accept stimuli and
        report results
    * **task_duration:** ``{key-prefix: time}``
        Time we expect certain functions to take, e.g. ``{'sum': 0.25}``

        Restart all workers. Reset local state. Optionally wait for workers to return.

        Workers without nannies are shut down, hoping an external deployment system
        will restart them. Therefore, if not using nannies and your deployment system
        does not automatically restart workers, ``restart`` will just shut down all
        workers, then time out!

        After ``restart``, all connected workers are new, regardless of whether ``TimeoutError``
        was raised. Any workers that failed to shut down in time are removed, and
        may or may not shut down on their own in the future.

        Parameters
        ----------
        timeout:
            How long to wait for workers to shut down and come back, if ``wait_for_workers``
            is True, otherwise just how long to wait for workers to shut down.
            Raises ``asyncio.TimeoutError`` if this is exceeded.
        wait_for_workers:
            Whether to wait for all workers to reconnect, or just for them to shut down
            (default True). Use ``restart(wait_for_workers=False)`` combined with
            :meth:`Client.wait_for_workers` for granular control over how many workers to
            wait for.

        .. warning::
           This operation is generally not well tested against normal operation of the
           scheduler. It is not recommended to use it while waiting on computations.

        **Algorithm**

        #. Find the mean occupancy of the cluster, defined as data managed by dask +
           unmanaged process memory that has been there for at least 30 seconds
           (``distributed.worker.memory.recent-to-old-time``).
           This lets us ignore temporary spikes caused by task heap usage.

           Alternatively, you may change how memory is measured both for the individual
           workers as well as to calculate the mean through
           ``distributed.worker.memory.rebalance.measure``. Namely, this can be useful
           to disregard inaccurate OS memory measurements.

        #. Discard workers whose occupancy is within 5% of the mean cluster occupancy
           (``distributed.worker.memory.rebalance.sender-recipient-gap`` / 2).
           This helps avoid data from bouncing around the cluster repeatedly.
        #. Workers above the mean are senders; those below are recipients.
        #. Discard senders whose absolute occupancy is below 30%
           (``distributed.worker.memory.rebalance.sender-min``). In other words, no data
           is moved regardless of imbalancing as long as all workers are below 30%.
        #. Discard recipients whose absolute occupancy is above 60%
           (``distributed.worker.memory.rebalance.recipient-max``).
           Note that this threshold by default is the same as
           ``distributed.worker.memory.target`` to prevent workers from accepting data
           and immediately spilling it out to disk.
        #. Iteratively pick the sender and recipient that are farthest from the mean and
           move the *least recently inserted* key between the two, until either all
           senders or all recipients fall within 5% of the mean.

           A recipient will be skipped if it already has a copy of the data. In other
           words, this method does not degrade replication.
           A key will be skipped if there are no recipients available with enough memory
           to accept the key and that don't already hold a copy.

        The least recently insertd (LRI) policy is a greedy choice with the advantage of
        being O(1), trivial to implement (it relies on python dict insertion-sorting)
        and hopefully good enough in most cases. Discarded alternative policies were:

        - Largest first. O(n*log(n)) save for non-trivial additional data structures and
          risks causing the largest chunks of data to repeatedly move around the
          cluster like pinballs.
        - Least recently used (LRU). This information is currently available on the
          workers only and not trivial to replicate on the scheduler; transmitting it
          over the network would be very expensive. Also, note that dask will go out of
          its way to minimise the amount of time intermediate keys are held in memory,
          so in such a case LRI is a close approximation of LRU.

        Parameters
        ----------
        keys: optional
            allowlist of dask keys that should be considered for moving. All other keys
            will be ignored. Note that this offers no guarantee that a key will actually
            be moved (e.g. because it is unnecessary or because there are no viable
            recipient workers for it).
        workers: optional
            allowlist of workers addresses to be considered as senders or recipients.
            All other workers will be ignored. The mean cluster occupancy will be
            calculated only using the allowed workers.

        Find workers that we can close with low cost

        This returns a list of workers that are good candidates to retire.
        These workers are not running anything and are storing
        relatively little data relative to their peers.  If all workers are
        idle then we still maintain enough workers to have enough RAM to store
        our data, with a comfortable buffer.

        This is for use with systems like ``distributed.deploy.adaptive``.

        Parameters
        ----------
        memory_ratio : Number
            Amount of extra space we want to have for our stored data.
            Defaults to 2, or that we want to have twice as much memory as we
            currently have data.
        n : int
            Number of workers to close
        minimum : int
            Minimum number of workers to keep around
        key : Callable(WorkerState)
            An optional callable mapping a WorkerState object to a group
            affiliation. Groups will be closed together. This is useful when
            closing workers must be done collectively, such as by hostname.
        target : int
            Target number of workers to have after we close
        attribute : str
            The attribute of the WorkerState object to return, like "address"
            or "name".  Defaults to "address".

        Examples
        --------
        >>> scheduler.workers_to_close()
        ['tcp://192.168.0.1:1234', 'tcp://192.168.0.2:1234']

        Group workers by hostname prior to closing

        >>> scheduler.workers_to_close(key=lambda ws: ws.host)
        ['tcp://192.168.0.1:1234', 'tcp://192.168.0.1:4567']

        Remove two workers

        >>> scheduler.workers_to_close(n=2)

        Keep enough workers to have twice as much memory as we we need.

        >>> scheduler.workers_to_close(memory_ratio=2)

            Mutually exclusive with ``workers``.
            If neither ``workers`` nor ``names`` are provided, we call
            ``workers_to_close`` which finds a good set.
        close_workers: bool (defaults to False)
            Whether or not to actually close the worker explicitly from here.
            Otherwise we expect some external job scheduler to finish off the
            worker.
        remove: bool (defaults to True)

            If close_workers=False and remove=False, this method just flushes the tasks
            in memory out of the workers and then returns.
            If close_workers=True and remove=False, this method will return while the
            workers are still in the cluster, although they won't accept new tasks.
            If close_workers=False or for whatever reason a worker doesn't accept the
            close command, it will be left permanently unable to accept new tasks and
            it is expected to be closed in some other way.
