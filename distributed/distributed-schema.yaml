            description:
              The number of retries before a task is considered bad

              When a worker dies when a task is running that task is rerun elsewhere.
              If many workers die while running this same task then we call the task bad, and raise a KilledWorker exception.
              This is the number of workers that are allowed to die before this task is marked as bad.

          bandwidth:
            type:
            - integer
            - string
            description:
              The expected bandwidth between any pair of workers

              This is used when making scheduling decisions.
              The scheduler will use this value as a baseline, but also learn it over time.

          blocked-handlers:
            type: array
            description:
              A list of handlers to exclude

              The scheduler operates by receiving messages from various workers and clients
              and then performing operations based on those messages.
              Each message has an operation like "close-worker" or "task-finished".
              In some high security situations administrators may choose to block certain handlers
              from running.  Those handlers can be listed here.

              For a list of handlers see the `dask.distributed.Scheduler.handlers` attribute.

          default-data-size:
            type:
            - string
            - integer
            description:
              The default size of a piece of data if we don't know anything about it.

              This is used by the scheduler in some scheduling decisions

          events-cleanup-delay:
            type: string
            description:
              The amount of time to wait until workers or clients are removed from the event log
              after they have been removed from the scheduler

          idle-timeout:
            type:
            - string
            - "null"
            description:
              Shut down the scheduler after this duration if no activity has occured

              This can be helpful to reduce costs and stop zombie processes from roaming the earth.

          transition-log-length:
            type: integer
            minimum: 0
            description:
              How long should we keep the transition log

              Every time a task transitions states (like "waiting", "processing", "memory", "released")
              we record that transition in a log.

              To make sure that we don't run out of memory
              we will clear out old entries after a certain length.
              This is that length.

          work-stealing:
            type: boolean
            description:
              Whether or not to balance work between workers dynamically

              Some times one worker has more work than we expected.
              The scheduler will move these tasks around as necessary by default.
              Set this to false to disable this behavior

          work-stealing-interval:
            type: string
            description:
              How frequently to balance worker loads
