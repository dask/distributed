              The number of retries before a task is considered bad

              When a worker dies when a task is running that task is rerun elsewhere.
              If many workers die while running this same task then we call the task bad, and raise a KilledWorker exception.
              This is the number of workers that are allowed to die before this task is marked as bad.

              The expected bandwidth between any pair of workers

              This is used when making scheduling decisions.
              The scheduler will use this value as a baseline, but also learn it over time.
