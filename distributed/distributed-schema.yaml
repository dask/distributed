              The number of retries before a task is considered bad

              When a worker dies when a task is running that task is rerun elsewhere.
              If many workers die while running this same task then we call the task bad, and raise a KilledWorker exception.
              This is the number of workers that are allowed to die before this task is marked as bad.

              The scheduler operates by receiving messages from various workers and clients
              and then performing operations based on those messages.
              Each message has an operation like "close-worker" or "task-finished".
              In some high security situations administrators may choose to block certain handlers
              from running.  Those handlers can be listed here.

              For a list of handlers see the `dask.distributed.Scheduler.handlers` attribute.

              Every time a task transitions states (like "waiting", "processing", "memory", "released")
              we record that transition in a log.

              To make sure that we don't run out of memory
              we will clear out old entries after a certain length.

              The scheduler almost never deserializes user data.
              However there are some cases where the user can submit functions to run directly on the scheduler.
              This can be convenient for debugging, but also introduces some security risk.
              By setting this to false we ensure that the user is unable to run arbitrary code on the scheduler.

              Over time the scheduler learns a duration for tasks.

              When many workers are created on the same process at once
              these workers can conflict with each other by trying to create this directory all at the same time.

              To avoid this, Dask usually used a file-based lock.
