Modified ThreadPoolExecutor to support threads leaving the thread pool

This includes a global `secede` method that a submitted function can call to
have its thread leave the ThreadPoolExecutor's thread pool.  This allows the
thread pool to allocate another thread if necessary and so is useful when a
function realises that it is going to be a long-running job that doesn't want
to take up space.  When the function finishes its thread will terminate
gracefully.

This code copies and modifies two functions from the
`concurrent.futures.thread` module, notably `_worker` and
ThreadPoolExecutor._adjust_thread_count` to allow for checking against a global
`threading.local` state.  These functions are subject to the following license,
which is included as a comment at the end of this file:

    https://docs.python.org/3/license.html

... and are under copyright by the Python Software Foundation
