def span(*tags: str) -> Iterator[None]:
    """Tag group of tasks to be part of a certain group, called a span.

    This context manager can be nested, thus creating sub-spans.
    Every cluster defines a global "default" span when no span has been defined by the client.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import dask.array as da
    >>> import distributed
    >>> client = distributed.Client()
    >>> with span("my_workflow"):
    ...     with span("phase 1"):
    ...         a = da.random.random(10)
    ...         b = a + 1
    ...     with span("phase 2"):
    ...         c = b * 2
    ... d = c.sum()
    >>> d.compute()

    In the above example,
    - Tasks of collections a and b will be annotated on the scheduler and workers with
      ``{'span': ('my_workflow', 'phase 1')}``
    - Tasks of collection c (that aren't already part of a or b) will be annotated with
      ``{'span': ('my_workflow', 'phase 2')}``
    - Tasks of collection d (that aren't already part of a, b, or c) will *not* be
      annotated but will nonetheless be attached to span ``('default', )``

    You may also set more than one tag at once; e.g.
    >>> with span("workflow1", "version1"):
    ...     ...


    Note
    ----
    Spans are based on annotations, and just like annotations they can be lost during
    optimization. Set config ``optimizatione.fuse.active: false`` to prevent this issue.
